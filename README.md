# Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard
Building a mechanical keyboard that splits down the middle from scratch. 

## Motivation
With my graduation from undergrad swiftly approaching, I've realized I'm not quite satisfied with any of the available options for quite possibly the most basic tool that I'll be using for the rest of my life: the keyboard. So far at my internships, I've been getting away with using the Kinesis Freestyle 2 (I won it at a hackathon by being the fastest at typing a solution to FizzBuzz with my nose). 

I have the following gripes:
- Not mechanical: actuation force is inconsistent between keys, the keys themselves feel mushy, I can't switch out the keycaps.
- Too many keys: the keyboard is too fat and clunky
- Keyboard layout is weird: Overall not horrible, and I can get used to it, but the function keys are in a weird spot.
- Aesthetics: It's an ugly grey color with ugly blue LEDs, and there are letters on the keycaps.
- Caps Lock: This key is useless and deserves to be removed with extreme prejudice.

My favorite keyboard so far has been the CM Storm Quickfire Rapid with brown switches. It feels well-built, the actuation force is uniform and feels just right for me, the detachable braided USB cable is raelly nice, and the keyboard just looks clean. This keyboard is my ideal gaming keyboard. Unfortunately it's not ergonomic, so I don't want to use it at work. Essentially, this project will try to build something like my Quickfire Rapid, but in place of a caps lock key there will be a control key, and it will split down the middle.
